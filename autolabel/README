First run `getlengths.py > lengthts of labeled.txt` in the directory of the labeled ones to get the lenghts of the properly labeled videos.
Then copy "lengths of labeled.txt" and "renamebasedonlength.py" into the folder with the unlabeled videos, and run it. 
Set "shouldrename = True" if you're confident it is doing it right.

For the future:
- Make Season parameter and should rename switch command line arguments, instead of editting the top of the script
- Make Season parameter uncessary (use Regex or something to figure out what the season is)
